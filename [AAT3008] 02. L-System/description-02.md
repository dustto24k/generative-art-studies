### Project 2: L-System

Make your own L-System and create an artwork based on it.

## Concept

![concept](https://github.com/dustto24k/weekly-p5js-23FW/assets/105871083/59f61207-1bfe-4bd2-8ab3-14c395702c2a)

Birds migrate in specific seasons. Most of these migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front, which reminded me of the principle of L-System.


Just like each node in the L-System, birds are all guided by one another, which implies it might be possible to implement the unpredictable movement of birds when migrating (often called as ‘synchronization’) by tweaking offsets that are used in Rules of the system.


## Rule

Instead of drawing immediately, I stored each render position in an array so I could apply animation later on. What’s different with other L-System patterns is that it doesn’t really need to look neat, but rather chaotic. (but still within order)
