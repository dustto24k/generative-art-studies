Find a target data to visualize (ex, public data, poem, sound, etc)
- Design visual domain that can represent the target data 
- Design the mapping between target data and visual domain
- Design user interaction 
- Determine what filters to use to limit the amount of data displayed
- Determine the navigation method


## Concept

Even hours of chess games can be written in data, by using a rule called ‘Algebraic chess notation’.


However, the data itself isn’t readable for amateurs, and require a set of physical board and pieces to follow the whole game. It’s mostly because the notation doesn’t mention the source but only records the destination, so by just looking at it doesn’t tell us the exact info of which colored piece in which location is moved.


Hence the goal of this project was to visualize the whole game by only relying on the given notation, from more than 20,000 games.
