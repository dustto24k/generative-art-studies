## Description

<br></br>
'Intro to Creative Computing (AAT2004-01)' and 'Creative Algorithms (AAT3008-01)' are Art & Technology undergraduate major courses at Sogang University. Both use p5js as lecture material and are beginner, intermediate classes, respectively. Somehow I took both classes in the same semester.
